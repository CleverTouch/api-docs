## [](#manipulating-the-result-set-)Manipulating the Result Set

Since `query` result sets are limited to 200 results each, the results returned may not include all prospects that were matched by the query. To retrieve the remaining results, the following criteria can be used to navigate through the result set.


| Parameter              | Datatype         | Options                                                                | Description |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `fields` | `array` | `<comma_separated_field_ids>` | Specifies the fields to be returned. **Note:** If this parameter isn't present, all default fields and custom fields for which the prospect has a value will be returned; &lt;id&gt; will always be returned. |
| `limit` | `integer` | `<any_positive_integer>` | Specifies the number of results to be returned. _Default value:_ `200`. **_Note:_** This number cannot be larger than 200. |
| `offset` | `integer` | `<any_positive_integer>` | Specifies the first matching prospect(according to the specified sorting order) to be returned in the query response. The first `offset` matching prospects will be omitted from the response. _Default value:_ `0`. **_Example:_** Specifying `offset=400` will return the results starting with the 401st prospect matched by the provided criteria. |
| `output` | `string` | `simple, mobile` | Specifies the format to be used when returning the results of the query. See [XML Response Formats](using-prospects#xml-response-formats) in [Using Prospects](using-prospects) for more details. |
| `sort_by` | `string` | `created_at, id, probability, value` | Specifies the field that should be used to sort the results of the query. See [Supported Sorting Options (#14784-supported-sorting-options) for more details. _Default value:_ `id`. |
| `sort_order` | `string` | `ascending, descending` | Specifies the ordering to be used when sorting the results of the query. The default value varies based on the value of the `sort_by` parameter. See [Supported Sorting Options](#supported-sorting-options) for more details. |

## [](#supported-sorting-options-)Supported Sorting Options

The ordering of the results returned by a `query` request can be changed by specifying `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters. Any of the following values are valid when specifying the `sort_by` parameter. For a complete list of fields involved in Prospect queries, see [Prospect](../object-field-references#prospect) in [Object Field References](../object-field-references).

| **Value** | **Default Sort Order** | **Description** |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| `created_at` | `descending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `created_at` timestamps. |
| `id` | `ascending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `id` fields. |
| `last_activity_at` | `descending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `last_activity_at` timestamps. |
| `updated_at` | `descending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `updated_at` timestamps. |

```
<rsp stat="ok" version="1.0">
    <result>
        <total_results>...</total_results>
        <prospect>...</prospect>
            ...
    </result>

```

| **Tag** | **Description** |
| ------- | --------------- |
| `<result>` | Contains the resulting prospects for the specified query. |
| `<total_results>` | Contains the number of prospects selected by this query. If this value is higher than 200, then several query requests may be necessary to retrieve all matched prospects. |
| `<prospect>` | The data for an individual Prospect. See [Using Prospects](using-prospects) for complete descriptions of prospect [XML Response Formats](using-prospects#xml-response-formats). Also see [Prospect](../object-field-references#prospect) in [Object Field References](../object-field-references). **_Note:_** Data concerning a prospect's profile criteria matchings, visitors, visitor activities, and list subscriptions will NOT be included in a `query` response. To retrieve this data, submit a `read` request for the prospect of interest. |
