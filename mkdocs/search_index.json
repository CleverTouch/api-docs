A few things of note:\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a question about the API, feel free to \nopen a ticket\n with our Support team.\n\n\nTo report an inconsistency in the documentation, please \nopen an issue on GitHub\n. \nPull requests\n are welcome as well!\n\n\nIf you've written your own library or wrapper for Pardot's API, submit a \npull request\n updating the \nindex.md\n file with a link to your repository, and we'll be glad to consider linking it up.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the API\n\n\nThe Pardot API allows your application to access current data within Pardot. Through the API, several common operations can be performed on Pardot objects. Operations include:\n\n\n\n\ncreate\n -- Creates a new object with the specified parameters.\n\n\nread\n -- Retrieves information about the specified object.\n\n\nquery\n -- Retrieves objects that match specified criteria.\n\n\nupdate\n -- Updates elements of an existing object.\n\n\nupsert\n -- Updates elements of an existing object if it exists.  If the object does not exist, one is created using the supplied parameters.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers must authenticate with the API before issuing requests.  Refer to the \nAuthentication\n section for details about this procedure.\n\n\nSome considerations must be taken while performing requests. When performing \nupdate\n requests, only the fields specified in the request are updated, and all others are left unchanged. If a required field is cleared during an \nupdate\n, the request will be declined.\n\n\nThe Pardot API handles a variety of requests for many of the\nobjects available through the Pardot user interface. Most requests\nto the API use the following standardized format. All requests must\nuse either HTTP GET or POST. Although GET requests are secure due\nto the use of SSL, we recommend using POST, with sensitive or\nlengthy parameter values being part of the POST message body.\nDevelopers are responsible for issuing requests with the following\ncomponents:\n\n\nPOST: https://pi.pardot.com/api/\nobject\n/version/3/do/\noperator\n/\nidentifier_field\n/\nidentifier\n\nmessage body: api_key=\nyour_api_key\nuser_key=\nyour_user_key\nparameters_for_request\n\n\nGET: https://pi.pardot.com/api/\nobject\n/version/3/do/\noperator\n/\nidentifier_field\n/\nidentifier\n?api_key=\nyour_api_key\nuser_key=\nyour_user_key\nparameters_for_request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobject\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe object type to be returned by the API request\n\n\n\n\n\n\noperator\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe operation to be performed on the specified object type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nidentifier_field\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe field to be used as the identifier for the specified object\n\n\n\n\n\n\nidentifier\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe identifier for the specified object(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour_api_key\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe API key that was obtained during \nAuthentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyour_user_key\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe user key that was used during \nAuthentication\n\n\n\n\n\n\nformat\n\n\n\n\nThe API data format. Either xml or json (xml is default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparameters_for_request\n\n\n\n\nParameters specific to your request; See individual methods for details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ordering of parameters is arbitrary. Parameters are passed using conventional HTML parameter syntax, with \n'?'\n indicating the start of the parameter string (for GET requests only) and \n'\n'\n as the separator between parameters. With the exception of \nformat\n and \nparameters_for_request\n, all components are required. Data returned from the API is formatted using JSON or XML 1.0 with UTF-8 character encoding. Keep in mind that some characters in the response may be encoded as HTML entities, requiring client-side decoding. Also, keep in mind that all parameters specified in an API request MUST be URL-encoded before they are submitted.\n\n\nIn general, the API will return XML or JSON containing a current version of the target object's data. However, unsuccessful requests will return a short response containing an error code and message. See \nError Codes \n Messages\n for error descriptions and suggested remedies.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the API Response Format\n\n\nThe Pardot API supports several output formats, each of which returns different levels of detail in the XML or JSON response. Output formats are defined by specifying the \noutput\n request parameter. Supported output formats include:\n\n\n\n\nfull\n -- Returns all supported data for the Pardot object and all objects associated with it.\n\n\nsimple\n -- Returns all supported data for the data for the Pardot object.\n\n\nmobile\n -- Returns an abbreviated version of the object data. This output format is ideal for mobile applications.\n\n\n\n\nIf the output request parameter is not defined, the output format defaults to \nfull\n. See the XML Response Format sections for each object for details about the formats.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nA few prerequisites must be met to successfully authenticate a\nconnection to the API.\n\n\n\n\nAll requests to the Pardot API must be made via SSL encrypted\nconnection.\n\n\nAuthentication requests must use HTTP POST.\n\n\nObtain the \nemail\n, \npassword\n, and \nuser_key\n (available in Pardot under \n{your email address} \n Settings\n in the API User Key row) for the Pardot user account that will be submitting API requests. If you need assistance in acquiring your user key, contact your Pardot support representative.\n\n\n\n\nWith these requirements met, an API key must be acquired. Both User and API keys are unique to individual users. API keys are valid for 60 minutes. In contrast, user keys are valid indefinitely. To authenticate, issue the following request (having replaced the values denoted by \ncarets\n with values for your account):\n\n\nPOST: https://pi.pardot.com/api/login/version/3\nmessage body: email=\nemail\npassword=\npassword\nuser_key=\nuser_key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe email address of your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe password of your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_key\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe 32-bit hexadecimal user key for your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf authentication was successful, a 32-character hexadecimal API\nkey will be returned in the following format:\n\n\nrsp stat=\nok\n version=\n1.0\n\n    \napi_key\n5a1698a233e73d7c8ccd60d775fbc68a\n/api_key\n\n\n/rsp\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the response will contain the following:\n\n\nrsp stat=\nfail\n version=\n1.0\n\n    \nerr code=\n15\nLogin failed\n/err\n\n\n/rsp\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsequent authentication requests will return either the current valid API key or a newly generated API key if the previous one had expired.\n\n\nAPI Console\n\n\nYou can explore Pardot's API in the \nAPI Console\n. Please note that we're in the process of adding new methods.\n\n\nSample Code\n\n\nHere's an example of calling the Pardot API using a simple PHP function and the cURL library.\n\n\nNote: we strongly recommend \nagainst\n using PHP's \nfile_get_contents\n function to call the Pardot API, since it makes error handling extremely cumbersome.\n\n\n/**\n * Call the Pardot API and get the raw XML response back\n *\n * @param string $url the full Pardot API URL to call, e.g. \nhttps://pi.pardot.com/api/prospect/version/3/do/query\n\n * @param array $data the data to send to the API - make sure to include your api_key and user_key for authentication\n * @param string $method the HTTP method, one of \nGET\n, \nPOST\n, \nDELETE\n\n * @return string the raw XML response from the Pardot API\n * @throws Exception if we were unable to contact the Pardot API or something went wrong\n */\nfunction callPardotApi($url, $data, $method = 'GET')\n{\n    // build out the full url, with the query string attached.\n    $queryString = http_build_query($data, null, '\n');\n    if (strpos($url, '?') !== false) {\n        $url = $url .

Supported output formats include:\n\n\n\n\nfull\n -- Returns all supported data for the Pardot object and all objects associated with it.\n\n\nsimple\n -- Returns all supported data for the data for the Pardot object.\n\n\nmobile\n -- Returns an abbreviated version of the object data. This output format is ideal for mobile applications.\n\n\n\n\nIf the output request parameter is not defined, the output format defaults to \nfull\n. See the XML Response Format sections for each object for details about the formats.\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nA few prerequisites must be met to successfully authenticate a\nconnection to the API.\n\n\n\n\nAll requests to the Pardot API must be made via SSL encrypted\nconnection.\n\n\nAuthentication requests must use HTTP POST.\n\n\nObtain the \nemail\n, \npassword\n, and \nuser_key\n (available in Pardot under \n{your email address} \n Settings\n in the API User Key row) for the Pardot user account that will be submitting API requests. If you need assistance in acquiring your user key, contact your Pardot support representative.\n\n\n\n\nWith these requirements met, an API key must be acquired. Both User and API keys are unique to individual users. API keys are valid for 60 minutes. In contrast, user keys are valid indefinitely. To authenticate, issue the following request (having replaced the values denoted by \ncarets\n with values for your account):\n\n\nPOST: https://pi.pardot.com/api/login/version/3\nmessage body: email=\nemail\npassword=\npassword\nuser_key=\nuser_key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe email address of your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe password of your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser_key\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe 32-bit hexadecimal user key for your user account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf authentication was successful, a 32-character hexadecimal API\nkey will be returned in the following format:\n\n\nrsp stat=\nok\n version=\n1.0\n\n    \napi_key\n5a1698a233e73d7c8ccd60d775fbc68a\n/api_key\n\n\n/rsp\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the response will contain the following:\n\n\nrsp stat=\nfail\n version=\n1.0\n\n    \nerr code=\n15\nLogin failed\n/err\n\n\n/rsp\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsequent authentication requests will return either the current valid API key or a newly generated API key if the previous one had expired.\n\n\nAPI Console\n\n\nYou can explore Pardot's API in the \nAPI Console\n. Please note that we're in the process of adding new methods.\n\n\nSample Code\n\n\nHere's an example of calling the Pardot API using a simple PHP function and the cURL library.\n\n\nNote: we strongly recommend \nagainst\n using PHP's \nfile_get_contents\n function to call the Pardot API, since it makes error handling extremely cumbersome.\n\n\n/**\n * Call the Pardot API and get the raw XML response back\n *\n * @param string $url the full Pardot API URL to call, e.g. \nhttps://pi.pardot.com/api/prospect/version/3/do/query\n\n * @param array $data the data to send to the API - make sure to include your api_key and user_key for authentication\n * @param string $method the HTTP method, one of \nGET\n, \nPOST\n, \nDELETE\n\n * @return string the raw XML response from the Pardot API\n * @throws Exception if we were unable to contact the Pardot API or something went wrong\n */\nfunction callPardotApi($url, $data, $method = 'GET')\n{\n    // build out the full url, with the query string attached.\n    $queryString = http_build_query($data, null, '\n');\n    if (strpos($url, '?') !== false) {\n        $url = $url . '\n' . $queryString;\n    } else {\n        $url = $url . '?' . $queryString;\n    }\n\n    $curl_handle = curl_init($url);\n\n    // wait 5 seconds to connect to the Pardot API, and 30\n    // total seconds for everything to complete\n    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 5);\n    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30);\n\n    // https only, please!\n    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS, CURLPROTO_HTTPS);\n\n    // ALWAYS verify SSL - this should NEVER be changed. 2 = strict verify\n    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2);\n\n    // return the result from the server as the return value of curl_exec instead of echoing it\n    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);\n\n    if (strcasecmp($method, 'POST') === 0) {\n        curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POST, true);\n    } elseif (strcasecmp($method, 'GET') !== 0) {\n        // perhaps a DELETE?\n        curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, strtoupper($method));\n    }\n\n    $pardotApiResponse = curl_exec($curl_handle);\n    if ($pardotApiResponse === false) {\n        // failure - a timeout or other problem. depending on how you want to handle failures,\n        // you may want to modify this code.

            "text": "The Pardot API allows your application to access current data within Pardot. Through the API, several common operations can be performed on Pardot objects. Operations include:   create  -- Creates a new object with the specified parameters.  read  -- Retrieves information about the specified object.  query  -- Retrieves objects that match specified criteria.  update  -- Updates elements of an existing object.  upsert  -- Updates elements of an existing object if it exists.  If the object does not exist, one is created using the supplied parameters.   Developers must authenticate with the API before issuing requests.  Refer to the  Authentication  section for details about this procedure.  Some considerations must be taken while performing requests. When performing  update  requests, only the fields specified in the request are updated, and all others are left unchanged. If a required field is cleared during an  update , the request will be declined.  The Pardot API handles a variety of requests for many of the\nobjects available through the Pardot user interface. Most requests\nto the API use the following standardized format. All requests must\nuse either HTTP GET or POST. Although GET requests are secure due\nto the use of SSL, we recommend using POST, with sensitive or\nlengthy parameter values being part of the POST message body.\nDevelopers are responsible for issuing requests with the following\ncomponents:  POST: https://pi.pardot.com/api/ object /version/3/do/ operator / identifier_field / identifier \nmessage body: api_key= your_api_key user_key= your_user_key parameters_for_request \n\nGET: https://pi.pardot.com/api/ object /version/3/do/ operator / identifier_field / identifier ?api_key= your_api_key user_key= your_user_key parameters_for_request      Parameter  Required  Description      object  X  The object type to be returned by the API request    operator  X  The operation to be performed on the specified object type    identifier_field  X  The field to be used as the identifier for the specified object    identifier  X  The identifier for the specified object(s)    your_api_key  X  The API key that was obtained during  Authentication    your_user_key  X  The user key that was used during  Authentication    format   The API data format. Either xml or json (xml is default)    parameters_for_request   Parameters specific to your request; See individual methods for details     The ordering of parameters is arbitrary. Parameters are passed using conventional HTML parameter syntax, with  '?'  indicating the start of the parameter string (for GET requests only) and  ' '  as the separator between parameters. With the exception of  format  and  parameters_for_request , all components are required. Data returned from the API is formatted using JSON or XML 1.0 with UTF-8 character encoding. Keep in mind that some characters in the response may be encoded as HTML entities, requiring client-side decoding. Also, keep in mind that all parameters specified in an API request MUST be URL-encoded before they are submitted.  In general, the API will return XML or JSON containing a current version of the target object's data. However, unsuccessful requests will return a short response containing an error code and message.

Prospects can be specified by their Pardot ID or email address. Users or groups can be specified by their Pardot user ID, email address, or Pardot group ID. Possible combinations of parameters are shown below. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by \ncarets\n.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?user_email=\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?user_id=\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/email/?group_id=\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_email=\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_id=\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?group_id=\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nXML responses to \nassign\n requests are identical to \nread\n requests, but reflect the new prospect assignment in the \nassigned_to\n node.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Prospects\n\n\nTo create a prospect via the API, only a valid and unique email address is required. Values for any other prospect fields may also be provided in the \ncreate\n request. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by \ncarets\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Creating a new prospect\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/create/email/\nnew_prospect@pardot.com\n?first_name=New\nlast_name=Prospect\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nXML responses to \ncreate\n requests are identical to \nupdate\n and \nread\n requests. If no \ncampaign_id\n value is provided, the new prospect will be automatically assigned to the oldest existing campaign.\n\n\n\n\nEndpoints for Batch Processing\n\n\nThere are 3 endpoints available for batch processing up to 50 prospects at a time:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchCreate\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpsert\n\n\nThese endpoints expect a query variable called \"prospects\" which holds either JSON or XML encoded data.\n\n\nJSON Example:\n\n\n{\n    \nprospects\n: {\n        \n1234\n: {\n            \nfirst_name\n: \nNew first name\n,\n            \nlast_name\n: \nNew last name\n\n        },\n        \nsome@email.com\n: {\n            \nfirst_name\n: \nNew first name\n,\n            \nlast_name\n: \nNew last name\n\n        },\n            \nsome.other@email.com\n: {\n            \nfirst_name\n: \nNew first name\n,\n            \nlast_name\n: \nNew last name\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nXML Example:\n\n\nprospects\n\n    \nprospect identifier=\n1234\n\n        \nfirst_name\nNew first name\n/first_name\n\n        \nlast_name\nNew last name\n/last_name\n\n    \n/prospect\n\n    \nprospect identifier=\nsome@email.com\n\n        \nfirst_name\nNew first name\n/first_name\n\n        \nlast_name\nNew last name\n/last_name\n\n    \n/prospect\n\n    \nprospect identifier=\nsome.other@email.com\n\n        \nfirst_name\nNew first name\n/first_name\n\n        \nlast_name\nNew last name\n/last_name\n\n    \n/prospect\n\n\n/prospects\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using \nbatchCreate\n, you'll need to provide a valid and unique email address for each prospect. The \nbatchUpdate\n and \nbatchUpsert\n endpoints allow the use of a prospect ID or prospect email address.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate?prospects={\"prospects\":{\"some@email.com\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"},\"1234\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"}}}\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nNote:\n The return value will either be XML or JSON (XML by default. If you want JSON, then add \"\nformat=json\" to your HTTP query).\n\n\nUpdating Field Values\n\n\nModifying values of prospect data fields is done by submitting an \nupdate\n request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as \nfield_name\n=\nvalue\n. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.\n\n\nExample:\n Updating the phone number of a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?phone=888-123-4567\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nOnly values that are specifically named in the request are updated. All others are left unchanged. To clear a value, submit an \nupdate\n request containing a parameter with no specified value, such as \nphone=\n.\n\n\nNote:\n Any field that is set to record multiple responses cannot have its values cleared this way.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Fields with Predefined Values\n\n\nModifying values of prospect data fields with predefined values is accomplished through an \nupdate\n request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as \nfield_name\n=\nvalue\n where \nvalue\n matches the predefined field value. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.\n\n\nExample:\n Updating the category of a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n *to the category \nconsumer\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?category=consumer\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Fields with Multiple Values\n\n\nUpdating field values with multiple values follows the same convention as fields with predefined values, but requires a different parameter naming scheme to allow multiplicity. An \nupdate\n request is submitted with parameters formatted as \nfield_name\n_\ncount\n=\nfield_value\n where \ncount\n is an integer denoting the current parameter's place in sequence. \ncount\n must start at 0 and increase by 1 until all desired values are submitted.\n\n\nExample:\n Modifying the values of a custom field with field name\n \npast_jobs\n \nfor a prospect with a Pardot ID of\n \n5\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/5?past_jobs_0=janitor\npast_jobs_1=security\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nNote:\n Checkbox and multi-select fields are the only field types that can be updated in this manner. To clear all of the values for a checkbox or multi-select field, use \nfield_name\n_0=\n. To clear specific values, just set the values that should remain in the prospect record using the method above.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Email List Subscriptions\n\n\nTo modify email list subscriptions for a prospect, the Pardot ID of the email list is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nlist_\nlist_id\n=1\n to create a subscription and \nlist_\nlist_id\n=0\n to end a subscription.\n\n\nExample:\n Adding a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n \nto an email list with Pardot ID\n \n8\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?list_8=1\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nRequests that attempt to subscribe a prospect to lists that it is already subscribed to are ignored. Unsubscribe requests are handled similarly.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Profile Criteria Matching Statuses\n\n\nTo modify a prospect's matching status for associated profile criteria, the Pardot ID of the profile criteria is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nprofile_criteria_\nprofile_criteria_id\n=\nstatus\n. The value of \nstatus\n may be either \nmatch\n, \nnomatch\n, or \nunknown\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a profile criteria for a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n \nto\n \nmatch\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?profile_criteria_8=match\napi_key=\nuser_key=\nExample:\n Setting a profile criteria for a prospect with Pardot ID\n \n58\n \nto\n \nnomatch\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/58?profile_criteria_8=nomatch\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nOnly profile criteria that belong to the profile associated with the prospect can be updated using this method. Requests to update profile criteria not associated with the assigned profile will be ignored. Using any matching status values other than \nmatch\n, \nnomatch\n, or \nunknown\n will result in an error message. See \nError Codes \n Messages\n for details.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Prospect Account Associations\n\n\nTo modify a prospect's matching status for associated prospect account, the Pardot ID of the prospect account is required. Once the ID is obtained, an \nupdate\n is submitted with parameters formatted as \nprospect_account_id=\nid\n.\n\n\nExample:\n Setting a prospect account for a prospect whose email address is\n \nbob@pardot.com\n \nto\n \nmatch\n: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/email/\nbob@pardot.com\n?prospect_account_id=\napi_key=\nuser_key=\n\n\nA prospect account with the id must exist, and can not be set if a CRM connector is set up in the account.",

JSON Example:  {\n     prospects : {\n         1234 : {\n             first_name :  New first name ,\n             last_name :  New last name \n        },\n         some@email.com : {\n             first_name :  New first name ,\n             last_name :  New last name \n        },\n             some.other@email.com : {\n             first_name :  New first name ,\n             last_name :  New last name \n        }\n    }\n}  XML Example:  prospects \n     prospect identifier= 1234 \n         first_name New first name /first_name \n         last_name New last name /last_name \n     /prospect \n     prospect identifier= some@email.com \n         first_name New first name /first_name \n         last_name New last name /last_name \n     /prospect \n     prospect identifier= some.other@email.com \n         first_name New first name /first_name \n         last_name New last name /last_name \n     /prospect  /prospects   If using  batchCreate , you'll need to provide a valid and unique email address for each prospect. The  batchUpdate  and  batchUpsert  endpoints allow the use of a prospect ID or prospect email address.  Example:  /api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate?prospects={\"prospects\":{\"some@email.com\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"},\"1234\":{\"first_name\":\"New first name\",\"last_name\":\"New last name\"}}} api_key= user_key=  Note:  The return value will either be XML or JSON (XML by default.
